# Pets-Classification-Semantic-Segmentation

A relatively simple project that involves classfying pets animals (cats and dogs) in a given image.

## Why Semantic Segmentation?

## Semantic vs Instance vs Panoptic

Image segmentation forms the basis of numerous computer vision tasks. Current image segmentation methods can be classified into three categories viz. Semantic segmentation, Instance segmentation and Panoptic segmentation. Semantic segmentation involves detecting objects within an image and grouping them based on defined categories. Instance segmentation takes semantic segmentation one step further and involves detecting objects within defined categories. Panoptic segmentation semantically distinguishes different objects as well as identifies separate instances of each kind of object.
Our project only requires distinguishing cats and dogs from the background therefore semantic segmentation was sufficient for the task.

## Semantic Segmentation

The aim of semantic image segmentation is to classify each pixel of an image into a predefined set of classes. Image segmentation is a computer vision task which involves labelling various regions of the image into objects that are present in it. We use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of semantic image segmentation.
